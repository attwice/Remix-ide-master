"contract. The JSON file contains the compilation's artifact.  Actually, "
"for this to happen, you need to check the Generate contract metadata box "
"in the General settings section of the Settings module.  The .JSON file "
"with the metadata will appear in the file explorer where the compiled "
"file is located."
