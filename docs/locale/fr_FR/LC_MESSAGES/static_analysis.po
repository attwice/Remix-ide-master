"Solidity Static Analysis plugin performs static analysis on Solidity "
"smart contracts once they are compiled. It checks for security "
"vulnerabilities and bad development practices, among other issues. This "
"plugin comes with Solidity environment of Remix IDE. It can also be "
"activated individually from Plugin Manager."

#: ../../static_analysis.md:11

"If you select this plugin, you will see a number of modules listed along "
